Robot Code 2015 [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/HarkerRobo/RobotCode2015.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/HarkerRobo/RobotCode2015)
==============

## Robot Code for 2015
### Installation Instructions
1. First and foremost clone the project. (If you are having trouble here please learn how to GitHub first)
2. Then, get the latest copy of HarkerRoboLib (link [here](https://github.com/HarkerRobo/HarkerRoboLib/))
3. Go into the build.xml file of the Robot Code project and find the line that reads 
  ```<arg value="/PATH/TO/ROBOLIB/HarkerRoboLib/src/" />``` and change the path to reflect the direction to the HarkerRoboLib source directory. This is VERY important. The code will not compile and will be very angry with you and spew lots of errors. [James Clark](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Clark_(XML_expert) will cry. Don't do that to him.
4. You're good to go! Have fun :)
